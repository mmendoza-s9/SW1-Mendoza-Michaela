	<title>My Favorite Music Genre </title>
	<h1 style="text-align: center;"> <strong> Indie Pop </strong> </h1>
<p><strong>Indie pop</strong> is a well known music genre to most teens and young adults <em>including myself</em>. <br> Most listen to indie pop because of how it sounds <br> and how well made each of the songs are made.</p>
<ul>

<h3> Reasons Why I love indie pop </h3> distict feature is how soothing it sounds. If you ever tried listening to Indie artists, you can tell that each of them have a relaxing but in somewhat upbeat vibe to them. Overall, Indie pop helps me sleep and is something I'd listen to when I study. </li>
	<li> Indie Pop is one of the first music genre's I listened to in highschool. I would regulary listen to Indie pop in my free time and in some occations while in class. </li>
	<li>It has a kind of DIY music style. In some of the artists I listened to, they either sample from already exsisting audios, or they simply make this soothingly calm track.</li>
	</ul>
